# MemoryGame
## Overview

This game tests the user's memory by shuffling around images. The goal of the game is to click as many different images before repeating yourself. After clicking an image, the app will shuffle the images randomly. If your guess was correct, your current score will increment. If you fail, but you beat your previous best, the page will show that as well.

This application was made using React.
